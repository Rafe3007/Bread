# Android App: Bread
A mobile game for Android about bread!
You are a baker and are receiving orders. You have to add just the right amount of ingredients to a bowl, mix, knead, and bake bread for your hungry customers! 

*The game is still in pre-alpha and further development of this current version is unconfirmed. Reason is that I would love to refractor many things of this app. This was a project to learn the basics of Kotlin and to get an app running on android operating system.*

## About the class
This is the Final Project for ATLS Course - Mobile App Development. Throughout the class we learned the basic principles of mobile app development and technical skills in creating our own applications. The course was taught in Swift to make iOS applications however, I decided to take the principles and learn Kotlin for Android throughout the course.
